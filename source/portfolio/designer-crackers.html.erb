<h1>Designer Crackers</h1>
<p>Although the previous site required a complete restructure, I didnâ€™t want to loose any of the purchasing simplicity in the redesign of this popular site.</p>

<p>We retained the purchasing from a category page, but structured the products into the different seasonal activities making it much easier for people to find party accessories.</p>
