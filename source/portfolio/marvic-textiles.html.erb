<h1>Marvic Textiles</h1>
<p>To kick this project off, we visited the Marvic showroom to observe the experience people have when interacting with the company. We learnt a lot about how their customers find fabrics they need, which heavily informed the siteâ€™s structure.</p>

<p>On launch, Marvic were the only company within their competitors to use a navigation structure based around how people want to find their fabric. It was a brave step for a high profile company, and has paid off in lower bounce rates and extremely good conversion rates.</p>
