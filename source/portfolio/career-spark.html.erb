<h1>Restless Development's Career Spark</h1>
<p>Young people in Uganda face many challenges, including 90% unemployment rates. Restless Development and the Forward Foundation are tackling that by introducing a new kind of internship.</p>

<p>I have been lucky to work with the team in Uganda to provide methods, support and advice for name generation and logo design, which created Career Spark.</p>

<p>I then applied the new branding to a mobile-friendly website design which will support the young people and employers in this new venture. The project is in its first phase during 2013.</p>
